# Auto Register Services By Class Name Suffix

Register every Controller, Repository or Command in your app. 

No need to do that manually in `config.yml` files. Very useful in large projects to keep configs clean.

## Install

```bash
composer require symplify/auto-service-registration
```

### Registration in Symfony

Add bundle to `AppKernel.php`:

```php
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles(): array
    {
        $bundles = [
            new Symplify\AutoServiceRegistration\Symfony\SymplifyAutoServiceRegistrationBundle(),
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```


## Usage in Symfony

```yml
# app/config/config.yml with default value
symplify_auto_service_registration:
    directories_to_scan: # where to scan classes
        - %kernel.root_dir%
        - %kernel.root_dir%/src
    class_suffixes_to_seek: # what class name suffixes to look for
        - Controller
```

That's all :)
